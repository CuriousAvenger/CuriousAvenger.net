				    Ever wished if teleportation was real like just think about all the possibilities you could achieve by the simple act of moving quickly from one location to the other, but unfortunately, it's quite not possible for humans to achieve this, at least for now. However, I have come up with an idea that might just enable us to do the exact thing stated otherwise. This analogy is different from my previous one on Quantum tennis, where this article talks more about the biology of teleportation rather than physics. So, without further ado, let's jump right in.
					<br><br>
First, let’s lay a general understanding of what teleportation is; in science fiction, the definition states that teleportation is the hypothetical transfer of matter or energy from one point to another without transversing the physical space between them. Simplifying, this means that teleportation is when a person travels from one point to another without actually having to move through space. My analogy is a bit different. It does give you the feeling of teleportation, but you must travel through space, and the only way of achieving teleportation while traveling through space is via traveling very fast. So, how is this possible. How is traveling "very fast" possible? We do have examples of jets, planes, cars, etc, but it doesn't quite give you the feeling of teleportation; we need something faster so, how are we gonna solve this problem?
					<br><br>
Initially, I came up with an analogy that instead of you traveling very fast, the world can slow down. In that case, whatever you do at a normal rate might seem to the outsider as if you were doing it extremely fast because you are not fast, the world is slow. Next problem, how can we make the time slow down for everyone? First, I thought about Einstein's work on time dilation, which talks about weight slowing down time. It works on the principle that the more massive or heavy (in terms of weight) an object is, the more it curves the spacetime fabric, and the more spacetime curves the slower time travels. In simple terms, when a massive object causes a curve in space-time, the distance that light must travel increases. Since velocity is distance times time, and velocity of light is constant, to maintain the same velocity, time must slow down. But, this analogy is hard to simulate in real life because it is near impossible to create a location on earth that negates the curvature already created by the mass of earth. So, the next question: Is it possible to negate the curvature of spacetime? In a recent video by Kurzgesagt, I came across a new kind of matter known as exotic matter. By definition, Exotic matter is a hypothetical kind of matter that has both a negative energy density and negative pressure or tension that exceeds the energy density; meaning, it is the matter with negative mass. I assumed that if mass causes an attraction force that slows downtime, then exotic matter causes a repelling force that speeds the flow of time. If the previous hypothesis is true, then you just need to wear or be made of exotic matter that will speed your time up. To others, you will look as if you were fast-forwarded, but to yourself, you will be doing things at a normal rate. This is an exceptional case because scientists are still working on the exotic matter, but if it is possible, then there is a high chance of simulating teleportation while concurrently being surrounded by normal human beings. EDIT: Future me here I just realized exotic matter shouldn't actually slow down time because if gravity causes spacetime fabric to curve, then negative mass causes gravity to create a bulge in spacetime fabric, which means that both circumstances increase the distance that light must travel and because the velocity of light is constant: time must slow down in both the situations. I didn't want to trash my work because I felt it was a good idea and maybe exotic matter comes with a few exceptions, which does result in a faster flowing of time. But, this, in reality, shouldn't work, so let's move on to a different analogy on how we can simulate teleportation.
					<br><br>
My second analogy deals with human biology. Yes, you heard me right, to teleport, you might need biology more than physics. Firstly, Let's ask the most basic question, what does it mean to work faster or react faster to things. It means that one can process information a lot faster than others can. We have daily examples like a mouse/rat can run faster than humans; it's almost like humans can never keep up with rats. Why So? I went to a website called speedofanimals.com, where you have animals' speed relative to its size, and like I predicted the 13Km/h speed of a mouse is equivalent to 260Km/h with respect to its size. A second thing that I also noticed was that despite a snail and tortoise being small in size, they don't have speed like a rat, but they do have slower heart rates, unlike mice. This sparked me the idea that maybe an animal's speed is dependent on its heart rate. But through further research, I found out that size matters when it comes to heartbeats. For example, animals to maintain a suitable body temperature like rats, need to have faster heartbeats to prevent themselves from freezing to death and vice versa for bigger animals. But, my stubborn mind came up with a thought experiment anyway; what if a person, ignoring the size restrictions, had a heartrate of 1 billion beats per second. I play sports, so I know that a higher heart rate means more blood can be pumped with each beat, benefitting athletes to exercise at a higher intensity for longer. What does that mean? It means that if I had a higher heartbeat, I would react faster to things; I would be able to process information faster per second. Like just imagine yourself playing baseball, and you have to catch a ball that is coming right at you. If you could process information at an infinitely faster rate, you would feel as if the ball was a lot slower. But in reality, it's not the ball, it's you who can see every microsecond at which the ball is coming towards you, or in other words, you are processing information a lot faster than others can, causing only you to feel such a way. With obvious regards, simulating your heartbeat to a billion beats per second might be hard and risky because humans on average have about 2 billion heartbeats before their heart starts to wear out and eventually die. But, using modern technology, I think this is highly possible, and the closest humans can do to achieve god-like reaction speeds. So, how does this relate to teleportation? This relates to teleportation because you walking normally would be a lot faster to others because you would process taking one step first and the next step, even before the other person can even realize what is happening, which should seem as if you just teleported, but in reality, you just walked a few steps faster than others could process it. A great example of this analogy is a scene from the x-men movie called "QUICKSILVER: The Fastest Man Alive (2014) X-MEN: Days of Future Past"; it is exactly how I assumed you would work if you just had faster reaction times compared to others.
					<br><br>
In the end, maybe teleportation isn't exactly what it looks like and doesn't necessarily have to deal with the transfer of information without moving through space, but instead, it's just a person who has the ability to react faster than you.
