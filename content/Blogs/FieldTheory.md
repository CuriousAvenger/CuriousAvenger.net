## Introduction

In today's article, we will be attempting to understand **Quantum Field Theory (QFT)**.

Quantum Physics or Quantum Mechanics is a fundamental theory that provides descriptions of the physical properties of nature at the scale of atomic and subatomic particles. Meaning, **Quantum physics is the study of extremely small particles** like atoms, protons, electrons, etc., and even subatomic or elementary particles like gluons, Higgs boson, photons, quarks, etc. Initially, I thought **quantum mechanics and quantum field theory meant the same thing**, but **quantum field theory is a part of quantum mechanics** that combines the elements of **special and general relativity** to explain the behavior and interactions at a subatomic level.

## The Origins of Quantum Mechanics

Quantum Mechanics began with scientists like **Einstein, Planck, etc.**, observing the **particle-wave duality of light**, which states that light exhibits properties of both waves and particles. **With the help of Bohr and Heisenberg**, they further extended their understanding to **matter itself**, discovering that even **subatomic particles attain this kind of particle-wave duality**.

From this emerges **Erwin Schrödinger's The Schrödinger Equation**, a wave function that:

- **Describes how matter waves change over time**
- **Helps us predict analytically and precisely the probability of the evolution of quantum systems**

However, **macrophysics didn’t cooperate with microphysics**. It's been long known that **Erwin Schrödinger's quantum mechanics model never worked out with Einstein's general and special relativity**. Relativity wants events to be **continuous and deterministic**, meaning that every cause matches up with a **specific local effect**, whereas **quantum mechanics produces events that are discontinuous and probabilistic** rather than definite outcomes.

Take for example **quantum jump or leap**: it is the quantum phenomenon where an **electron or an atom can abruptly transition from one discrete energy state to another when it interacts with photons of light**. The **abrupt transition states** that the electron moves to a different energy state **without having to move through space** or, in other words, has a **discontinuous trajectory**. Overall, in the microscopic realm, there is **uncertainty, chaos, fluctuations, and entanglements**, all of which go against **Einstein's gentle, smooth, and deterministic model of the curved spacetime continuum**.

## The Conflict Between Quantum Mechanics and Relativity

This contradiction left English theoretical physicist **Paul Dirac** curious if he could **find a way to combine these two equations**.

Dirac started with **Einstein's relativity equation** and attempted to **unify it with the spin** - an intrinsic property of all elementary particles - of a quantum object. He was stuck in a tangent of messy mathematics until he **stumbled upon a new idea of including anti-spin into his equations**. This led all that **messy mathematics to simplify into a single beautiful equation known as the Dirac equation**, which successfully **predicted the motion of electrons at any speed**, even **whilst present in other fields like an electromagnetic field**, compared to Schrödinger's equation that was **confined to only describing the possible positions of electrons with no internal properties**.

### The Discovery of Antimatter

When solving his equation, Dirac encountered **two solutions**:

1. **A positive solution**, representing matter.
2. **A negative solution**, implying the existence of **antimatter**.

Initially confused, Dirac later proposed the **Dirac Sea** analogy:

- Imagine an infinite "sea" of electrons filling all negative energy states.
- Removing an electron leaves a **hole**, which behaves like a **positron** (the antimatter counterpart of an electron).

Although the Dirac sea doesn’t exist, these holes act as a visualization of what is now called **antimatter**. It is said that during the **Big Bang**, the universe **released equal amounts of matter and antimatter**, but **why matter is more abundant remains an open question**.

## What is Quantum Field Theory (QFT)?

**Quantum Field Theory (QFT) is a theory that describes all elementary particles and their antiparticle counterparts as excitations or vibrations in their respective fundamental fields that exist throughout the universe**.

Meaning:

- Every elementary particle has a **field**, like the **electromagnetic field for a proton**, but in this case, it is for **every elementary particle**, where the **particle itself is an oscillation or peak in the field**.
- By representing **particles as fields**, **Dirac's equation worked better** in predicting the **evolution and interactions of quantum systems** than Schrödinger's equation.
- **This concept is known as the Second Quantization**, whereas **Schrödinger's equation is the First Quantization**.

### Feynman's Path Integral Formulation

Physicist **Richard Feynman** extended QFT using the **Path Integral Formulation**, which states that:

- A **quantum system can and will take all of the possible paths before and after measurement**.
- However, the **most extreme paths cancel out**, leaving only **a few interactions that we experience daily**.

## Conclusion

Quantum Field Theory is **one of the most successful theories ever proposed**, mainly due to:

- **Its predictive power about quantum systems**.
- **Its ability to unify relativity with quantum mechanics**.
- **Its profound implications, suggesting even more remarkable discoveries in the future**.
